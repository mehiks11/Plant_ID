### Project Proposal Template

#### Question/need:
* The framing goal of this project involves classification of plants via image.
* In recent years, there has been an upsurge of house plant buyers. Many plants at stores like lowe's or home depot are often unidentified. Additionally, with more people rediscovering nature during the pandemic, more people are interacting with unknown plant species they might be curious about. This exploration can be of great benefit to either of these relevant populations in identifying plant species!

#### Data Description:
* I plan to use a large set of plant image data.
* An individual unit of data is simply a labelled plant image.
* The model will classify a plant and name it with the given common household name of the plant, along with the scientific name. 

#### Tools:
* I plan to use cloud computing if necessary for computing the large amount of data.
* Additionally, I will use pandas, keras, and tensor for image processing and model building
* I hope to project the results of this model into a user friendly app format for use
* Additionally, I will use external tabular data to provide care tips/fun facts for an identified plant

#### MVP Goal:
* A goal MVP is a smaller neural network built with a subset of the larger dataset?
